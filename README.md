This repository contains core implementation code of the paper:

**"LMF-Net: A Mamba-based Enhancement Network for Low-light Object Detection"**

## ðŸ“Œ Abstract

Object detection in low-light conditions remains challenging. An intuitive approach is to preprocess images using low-light image enhancement methods. However, as these methods are optimized for human perception rather than machine vision, most of them lead to suboptimal detection performance. To address this limitation, we propose a detection-oriented enhancement network that jointly optimizes both tasks, Low-light Mamba Frequency Network (LMF-Net).

ðŸ•’ **Note:**  
Full training code, preprocessing scripts, and pretrained weights will be released **upon official acceptance of the paper**.
